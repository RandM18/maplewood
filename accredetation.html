                        <p>
                            Maplewood Career Center is approximately 217,000 square foot vocational facility located on approximately 100 acres. The Adult Workforce Development Programs at Maplewood Career Center are state supported post-secondary education programs. A certificate of completion is awarded to all students satisfactorily completing any program. Programs allow students to upgrade their skills in their present job, or prepare for a new career. Students obtain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience through “hands-on” experience in well-equipped laboratories. Over 60 percent of a student’s scheduled time is shop or lab experience.
